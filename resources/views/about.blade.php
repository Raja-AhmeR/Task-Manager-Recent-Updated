                            A ToDoList web app is a digital application that allows users to create, manage, and organize
                            their tasks or to-do items in a convenient and efficient way. It helps users keep track of their
                            responsibilities, deadlines, and priorities, making it easier to stay organized and productive.

                            Here are some key features commonly found in ToDoList web apps:

                            <div class="m-3 p-3">
                                <ol type="1" class="list-group">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">
                                        Task creation: Users can create new tasks by providing a title, description, due date, and
                                        possibly other relevant details. This feature allows users to quickly capture and record
                                        their
                                        tasks.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">
                                        Task management: Users can organize their tasks by categorizing them into different lists or
                                        adding labels, tags, or priorities. This helps users visually differentiate between various
                                        tasks and manage them effectively.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">
                                        Task editing and updating: Users can modify existing tasks by editing their titles,
                                        descriptions, due dates, or other attributes. This feature allows users to keep their task
                                        information up to date.
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">
                                        Task prioritization: Users can assign priorities or set importance levels to tasks to
                                        indicate their relative significance. This feature helps users focus on high-priority tasks
                                        and
                                        manage their time more efficiently.

                                        Task completion and archiving: Users can mark tasks as complete once they are finished.
                                        Completed tasks are typically moved to an archived section or hidden from the main task
                                        view,
                                        reducing clutter and providing a sense of accomplishment.

                                        alert users about approaching deadlines or scheduled tasks. This feature helps users stay on
                                        top
                                        of their tasks and avoid missing important deadlines.

                                    <li class="list-group-item">
                                        Task sharing and collaboration: Some ToDoList web apps allow users to share tasks or task
                                        lists with others, enabling collaboration and coordination among team members or family
                                        members.
                                        This feature is particularly useful for project management or group tasks.
